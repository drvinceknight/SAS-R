# Intended learning outcomes for this module:

# How the material will be taught (first term):

- Need to complete 80% of 'TICKABLES';
- **YOU WILL NEED TO WORK OUTSIDE OF THE LABS TO HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE LAB SHEETS**
- Lecture on Thursday 1100;

# What you should do next:

- Download and install Python (**version 2.x**) on your own machine if you have one:
    - If you have a windows machine follow the instruction at [www.python.org/](http://www.python.org/)
    - If you have a linux machine or using Mac OS (both of these are 'nix' machines) then python is already installed.
- Start working on the first lab sheet.
- Organise a study group of 4 to 5 people to work together (I suggest finding people in your own tutor groups).
