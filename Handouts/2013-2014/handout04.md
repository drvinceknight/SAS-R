## What you have learnt this week:

- How to create an unsorted list;
- Some sorting algorithms;
- Some searching algorithms.

## Functions

Some of us are still having problems understanding important concepts of functions:

- Defining functions;
- Using functions.

In *mathematics* we'll often see things like this:

---

Let us define \\(f(x)=x^2\\), \\(g(x)=x^3-1\\) and \\(h(x)=\sqrt{x}\\).

Calculate \\(f(x)\\), \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) for \\(x\\) taking on the following values: \\(0, .5, 1, 3\\).

---

We would simply calculate this by hand as follows:

- \\(f(0)=0, f(.5)=.25, f(1)=1, f(3)=9\\)
- \\(g(0)=-1, g(.5)=-.875, g(1)=0, g(3)=26\\)
- \\(h(0)=0, g(.5)\approx .707, g(1)=1, g(3)\approx 1.732\\)

Our question could then go on to ask:

---

Now define \\(k(x) = f(g(h(x)))\\). Which function (\\(h,f,g\\) or \\(k\\)) has the lowest mean value over the above list of values?

---

Here we would calculate \\(k(x)\\) for the above function:

- \\(k(0)=f(g(h(0)))=f(g(0))=f(-1)=1, k(.5)\approx .418, k(1)=0, k(3)\approx 17.608\\)

From here we would write: let \\(a, b, c, d\\) be the mean values of \\(h, f, g, k\\) respectively.

$$a\approx 2.563, b\approx 6.03, c\approx.860,d\approx4.756$$

The way we have *defined* functions and passed values to them is exactly the same as we would do it in Python:

    def f(x):
        """
        return f(x) from example
        """
        return x ** 2

    def g(x):
        """
        return g(x) from example
        """
        return x ** 3 - 1

    def h(x):
        """
        return h(x) from example
        """
        return x ** (1/float(2))

    values = [0, .5, 1, 3]  #Â This defines our list of values
    for x in values:  # We now loop over our values
        print "When x=%s" %x
        print "f(x)=%s" % f(x)  # Here we calculate f(x) for a given x
        print "g(x)=%s" % g(x)  # Here we calculate g(x) for a given x
        print "h(x)=%s" % h(x)  # Here we calculate h(x) for a given x

Now to do the second half of the problem:

    def k(x):
        """
        Using our previously defined functions to define k(x)
        """
        return f(g(h(x)))

    print [k(x) for x in values]  # This just return k(x) for x in values using list comprehensions (this is another way of what we did above)

    def mean(lst):
        """
        A function to return the mean of a list

        Arguments: lst: a list

        Outputs: The mean of all elements in lst
        """
        return sum(lst) / len(lst)

    print "f: %s" % mean([f(x) for x in values])
    print "g: %s" % mean([g(x) for x in values])
    print "h: %s" % mean([h(x) for x in values])
    print "k: %s" % mean([k(x) for x in values])

## Sorting algorithms

- We saw two algorithms for sorting scrambled lists:
    - Selection sort
    - Bubble sort (this was not a tickable)

## Searching algorithms

- We saw binary search this week which relies on constantly 'dividing' a list in to two smaller lists:

## The class test (8th of November)

- 50 minute class test.
- The class test will have 3 questions:

    - Q1 will be a **non tickable** question from the lab sheets;
    - Q2 will be a question of comparable difficulty to what has been done in the lab sheets;
    - Q3 will be a harder question similar to a question from the lab sheets.
- This will be an open 'book' test. You will have access to the internet, **BUT NOT TO EMAIL** or any other communication with other students: make sure your scripts from the sheets are on your machine: 'I was just logging in to my email to get my sheets' will not be tolerated.
- You will write 3 scripts (1 for each question) and will be uploading and emailing them.

## What you should do next:

- Start revising for the class test: work through all your lab sheets. If you can do exercises in the lab sheets (not just 'understand them' but actually 'do them') you will be fine.
- **Start the next sheet**, there is quite a lot to learn and Object Orientated Programming is a very powerful tool so make sure you make progress outside of the labs.
- To make the best use of the lab sessions turn up having finished your sheets;
- If anything is still unclear **please** come and see me during office hours.
