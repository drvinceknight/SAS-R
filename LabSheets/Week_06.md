Now that we have a good knowledge of programming we can take a closer look at a Mathematics package. There are a variety of such packages: [Maple](http://www.maplesoft.com/products/maple/), [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/products/) and others. The mathematics package we will use is called [Sage](http://sagemath.org/), as stated on the Sage website ([sagemath.org](http://sagemath.org/)):

> Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.

Sage being an open-source program means that it is being developed by other mathematicians all over the world. It is also completely free (so you can download a copy on your own computer).

Sage allows us to solves equations, differentiate expressions, plot graphs and do various other mathematical operations.

**Sage is based on Python so you can use all the general programming techniques you have learnt up until now in Sage.** Sage has all of the commands and functions you are used to in Python although some might do a bit more. Sage also has a lot of built in objects for specific mathematical operations.

A YouTube playlist with all the videos for this lab sheet can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnC5h3PY-znyytHl2YQjE41o-TdfewmKr).

1. **TICKABLE** Open Sage

    Navigate to [sage.maths.cf.ac.uk](https://sage.maths.cf.ac.uk/) where you can setup a user account following these instructions:

    1. Click on 'Sign up for a new Sage Notebook account';
    2. **Use your cardiff university username as the username for Sage**;
    3. This will create an account, you will be taken to the login screen again, use the above login details to login.

    Take a look at the following video that goes through this process as well as shows you how to create your first Sage worksheet.

    **If you forget your password DO NOT CREATE ANOTHER ACCOUNT: come and see me (Vince Knight) and I can reset your password.**

2. **TICKABLE** It is very easy to get help in Sage. Simply type any command followed by a `?` to get a help file for it:

        cos?
        sum?

3. We can use Sage as an advanced calculator. Try out the following commands:

        cos(3)
        cos(3.)
        sqrt(4)
        sqrt(8)
        sqrt(8.)

    Sage uses `I` to denote the imaginary constant:

        I ** 2
        sqrt(-53.)


4. **TICKABLE** Obtain an exact form for \\(\sum_{i=1}^5\frac{1}{\sqrt{i}}\\). Once you have an expression, experiment with the `factor`, `simplify` and `expand` functions.

5. Sage can also be used to obtain prime factors of numbers:

        factor(234398)

    We can do this as above using a function but also using the `factor` method on the object: `234398`:

        234398.factor()

    To obtain the number of prime factors that a number has we can use the `len` function or method:

        f = 234398.factor()
        len(f)

    Obtain the mean number of factors for the first 1000 integers (you can use the `mean` sage function).

6. Using the `is_prime` method investigate the following claim:

   All numbers of the form \\(k^2-79k+1601\\) are prime for \\(k\in\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(k\geq 3\\).

7. **TICKABLE** A very important aspect of Sage is it's ability to handle symbolic computation. In other words it is capable of simplifying:

    $$x^2 - 3x^2 + 4xy - 81 y^2$$

    To do so we need to first declare symbolic variables:

        y = var('y')

    (We could also declare `x` but `x` is a default variable in Sage that is always declared). Once we have done that we can assign the above expression to a variable:

        myexp = x ** 2 - 5 * x ** 2 + 12 * x * y - 9 * y ** 2

    Note that here I'm using the exponentiation used in python: `**` but in Sage we can also use `^`:

        myexp = x ^ 2 - 5 * x ^ 2 + 12 * x * y - 9 * y ^ 2

    Once we have done that we can factorise the expression using the `factor` method:

        myexp.factor()

8. We can also define functions in Sage. The following code defines \\(f:x\to x^3 + \pi x^2-\frac{23}{2}x^2+15x-\frac{23}{2}\pi x+15\pi\\):

        f(x) =  x^3 + pi*x^2 - 23/2*x^2 - 23/2*pi*x  + 15*x+ 15*pi

    To take a look at \\(f\\) we can use the `plot` function:

        plot(f(x), x, -15, 15)

    Experiment with the arguments in that expression.

    To idenfity the 3 (visible on the plot) roots of our function we can use the `roots` method on \\(f\\):

        f.roots()

    We can also try to factorise \\(f\\):

        f.factor()

    Finally we can use the `solve` function:

        solve(f(x) == 0, x)

9. **TICKABLE** Using Sage obtain the solution to the following equations:

    1. \\(x^2 = -1\\)
    2. \\(x^2 - 53 x + 2 a = 0\\)
    4. \\(\sin(x) = x - 1\\) (Investigate the Sage function `find_root`)
    3. \\(x^5 + \sin(x) - 2x = .5\\)

    [Video hint](http://youtu.be/GVEbkBXBmTw)

10. It is also possible to solve systems of equations using Sage. In this case we pass a list of equations as arguments to the `solve` function. The following code gives a solution to this system of equations:

    $$\begin{cases}
    x + y = z\\
    3 x - y = 0\\
    y + z = 1
    \end{cases}$$

        y, z = var('y', 'z')
        solve([x + y == z, 3*x - y == 0, y + z ==1], [x, y, z])
