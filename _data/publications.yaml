        abstract: Various approaches have been used to identify possible routes for
            improvement of patient flow within an emergency unit ({EU}). One such
            approach is to use simulation to create a ‘real world’ model of an {EU}
            and carry out various tests to gauge ways of improvement. This paper proposes
            a novel approach in which simulation is used to create a ‘perfect world
            model’. The {EU} at a major {UK} hospital is modelled not as it is, but
            as it could be. The ‘efficiency gap’ between the ‘perfect world’ and the
            ‘real world’ demonstrates how operational research can be used effectively
            to identify the location of bottlenecks in the current ‘whole hospital’
            patient pathway and can be used in the planning and managing of hospital
            resources to ensure the most effective use of those resources.

        abstract: Abstract It is well observed that individual behaviour can have
            an effect on the efficiency of queueing systems. The impact of this behaviour
            on the economic efficiency of public services is considered in this paper
            where we present results concerning the congestion related implications
            of decisions made by individuals when choosing between facilities. The
            work presented has important managerial implications at a public policy
            level when considering the effect of allowing individuals to choose between
            providers. We show that in general the introduction of choice in an already
            inefficient system will not have a negative effect. Introducing choice
            in a system that copes with demand will have a negative effect.
