	abstract = {Various approaches have been used to identify possible routes for improvement of patient flow within an emergency unit ({EU}). One such approach is to use simulation to create a ‘real world’ model of an {EU} and carry out various tests to gauge ways of improvement. This paper proposes a novel approach in which simulation is used to create a ‘perfect world model’. The {EU} at a major {UK} hospital is modelled not as it is, but as it could be. The ‘efficiency gap’ between the ‘perfect world’ and the ‘real world’ demonstrates how operational research can be used effectively to identify the location of bottlenecks in the current ‘whole hospital’ patient pathway and can be used in the planning and managing of hospital resources to ensure the most effective use of those resources.},

It is well observed that individual behaviour can have an effect on the efficiency of queueing systems. The impact of this behaviour on the economic efficiency of public services is considered in this paper where we present results concerning the congestion related implications of decisions made by individuals when choosing between facilities. The work presented has important managerial implications at a public policy level when considering the effect of allowing individuals to choose between providers. We show that in general the introduction of choice in an already inefficient system will not have a negative effect. Introducing choice in a system that copes with demand will have a negative effect.},
