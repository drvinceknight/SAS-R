# Reflections on some feedback

# Negative about methodology

"Feel like we have to teach ourselves."

"... Rather than telling us what to do and what code to write, explain why we do it THOROUGHLY. MORE HAND OUTS!"

# Positive about methodology

"The help you receive if you don't understand is personal."

# Why are we doing this?

"Be an optional module? Its not really a core topic."

# I'm bored in labs

"Lots of time spent sitting around waiting."

# More exercises

"Give extra exercises for more practice."

"Work sheets are helpful because they have more questions than what needs to be done and ticked off"

# Quirky or Amusing

"I know the focus for this is to be able to program the computer to help with maths and calculation, but maybe especially in the early lab sheets include some tasks that are quirky or amusing."

# Glossary please

"A glossary of terms and built in functions would be useful."
