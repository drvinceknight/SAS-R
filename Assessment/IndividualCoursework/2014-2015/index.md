The outputs of this coursework will be:

- A written report describing your code (SAS and R) to be handed in to Joanna Emery.
- An appendix containing a commented version of your code (SAS and R) to be handed in to Joanna Emery.
- A file containing the required SAS code. Name this file SAS-lastname-STUDENTNUMBER (eg. Knight-123456) and email it to Joanna Emery with MAT013 as the subject. Note that all operations needed to complete the coursework should be included in the SAS code.
- A file containing the required R code. Name this file R-lastname-STUDENTNUMBER (eg. Knight-123456) and email it to Joanna Emery with MAT013 as the subject. Note that all operations needed to complete the coursework should be included in the R code.
