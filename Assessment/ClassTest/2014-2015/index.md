#MAT013 Class Test

## Instructions:

- *This is an open book test. You are encouraged to use the internet, your notes etc..., however no communication with any other student is allowed.*
- *The output of this class test will be: a file containing the SAS program with any comments included and a file containing the R code with any comments included.*

Once you have finished the test:

1. Call the file for the SAS code: `SAS-lastname-STUDENTNUMBER` (eg. SAS-Knight-123456) and call the file for the R code: `R-lastname-STUDENTNUMBER` (eg. R-Knight-123456).
2. Email both files to Joanna Emery (EmeryJL4@cf.ac.uk) with 'MAT013 - lastname-STUDENTNUMBER' as the subject. **ALL EMAILS MUST BE SENT BEFORE LEAVING THE COMPUTER LAB**.

## Class test:

1. Using both SAS and R (in other words attempt this question using SAS and then using R):

    Create a data set with two variables: "Week" and "Ranking". For every week of the MAT013 course (1-5 including this class test) give a ranking of your enjoyment of each week of the course (1 being the best). Write some code (in both SAS and R) to sort this data set in descending order of the enjoyment ranking.

2. Using SAS:

    Something to do with pairs of files that need an outer right merge in a
    zipped folder.

3. Using R:

    A perfect number is a natural number that is equal to the sum of its
    divisors (excluding itself). For example \\(1,2,4,7\\) and \\(14\\) divide
    \\(28\\) and \\(28=1+2+4+7+14\\).

    Write code that write to a csv file the first 10000 Natural numbers as well
    as a boolean variable indicating whether or not that number is perfect.

4. Using either SAS or R:

    The data set blablabla contains data for a number of fields...

    Create a new data set that gets value of field depending on type of field.
