# MAT013 Group Coursework

*Deadline: ?*

## Instructions

The outputs of this coursework will be:

- A 20 minute group presentation/demonstration to be given during the week
  commencing 2015-05-05 (5th of May) followed by 10 minutes for questions.
- All relevant files (code, presentation, notes etc...), websites, demo materials etc should be passed to Joanna Emery or Vincent Knight on or before the 2015-05-08.

## Coursework

As a group you are required to present an aspect of R and/or SAS that is not present in the notes. The presentation should be viewed as a teaching presentation and here are some potential examples:

- Demonstrating how to use a particular aspect of R and/or SAS (an R package for example);
- Explaining certain technical aspects of R and/or SAS (for example if the Program Data Vector had not been explained in class this would have been a potential subject);
- Solving a particular problem using R and/or SAS using techniques not specifically looked at.

You are not constrained by the use of slides (although you are welcome to). Feel free to be imaginative.

**On selection of a topic, it is advisable to ask Vincent Knight whether or not it is suitable.**

Marking criteria:

- Difficulty: [30]
- Accuracy: [30]
- Originality: [20]
- Presentation/demonstration: [20]
